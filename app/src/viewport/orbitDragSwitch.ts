/**
 * orbitDragSwitch — the two things OrbitControls decides once, at
 * pointerdown, that Hew needs to change WHILE a drag is live:
 *
 * 1. **Shift mid-drag inverts orbit ↔ pan** (and back on release).
 *    OrbitControls reads `shiftKey` only in its pointerdown handler;
 *    pressing Shift halfway through an orbit changed nothing but the
 *    cursor, which promised a pan that never came. `switchDragTo` flips the
 *    live gesture the way a fresh press would have started it: the drag
 *    state changes, the new gesture's origin is re-seeded at the CURRENT
 *    pointer so the view doesn't jump, and the old gesture's pending delta
 *    is zeroed so an orbit stops turning the instant Shift lands instead of
 *    coasting on inertia under the pan. The rule is symmetric and
 *    button-agnostic — `desiredDragState(base, shiftHeld)`: a button's own
 *    binding (`baseBindingFor`) while Shift is up, the other one while it
 *    is held — so it also returns a Shift-started pan to an orbit when Shift
 *    is released, and inverts the Pan tool's left-drag the same way.
 *
 * 2. **Precise orbit** (no inertia) on Ctrl/⌘. `enableDamping` is what
 *    gives the camera its coasting tail — and, less obviously, its lag while
 *    the pointer is still moving (each frame applies only `dampingFactor`
 *    of the pending delta). `setPreciseOrbit(on)` turns damping off for as
 *    long as the modifier is held and drops whatever tail is in flight, so
 *    the camera tracks the pointer 1:1 and stops dead when it does.
 *    OrbitControls itself treats a Ctrl/⌘ press as another "invert the
 *    button" modifier; `forceBaseAfterPress` undoes that right after its
 *    pointerdown handler ran, so Ctrl/⌘ means precision, and only Shift
 *    means invert.
 *
 * Both reach into OrbitControls' underscore-private fields. three.js does
 * not declare them (`OrbitControls.d.ts` exposes neither `state` nor the
 * `_rotateStart`/`_panStart`/`_sphericalDelta`/`_panOffset` scratch
 * vectors), so this module is the ONE place that names them, behind a
 * typed view, with the enum values pinned to `_STATE` in OrbitControls.js.
 * A three.js upgrade that renames any of these fails the feature — never
 * the build — which is why `orbitDragState` answers `'unsupported'` rather
 * than guessing when the shape isn't recognised, and every switch reports
 * whether it actually happened. `orbitDragSwitch.test.ts` constructs a real
 * OrbitControls to pin the field names against the installed three.js.
